  bio1: `agency. I was born and raised in New York City and currently
    attend Howard University. Since a young kid, I’ve been surrounded by music, whether I was riding in the back of father’s car with Jay Z on the radio or running around the house with Lil Wayne on my brother’s iPod or Sunday’s cleaning with Erykah Badu on the tv. Looking up to these musicians, i initially wanted to make music myself. After doing that for a little while, I found more passion in creating opportunities for musicians and other creatives. It led me to curating events whether that be coordination from scratch or assisting in the talent scouting. I also emcee at some of these events. You can view my curation work on my “Highlights” page. I look forward to helping you all throw the best event! `,
  bio2: `Another thing I awkwardly enjoyed since adolescence was being in front of a camera. Pictures, to me, feel like memories, capturing your aura in that certain moment of time. They say pictures are worth a thousand words; I think you can’t measure the worth of pictures in words without infinite. I use my pictures as art, a way to expressions those feelings that I struggle to express verbally. I hope my art makes somebody feel a certain way by looking at it. Check out the “Portfolio” tab to peek into my thoughts. Can’t wait to help you execute your idea!`,
